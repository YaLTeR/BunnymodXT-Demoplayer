==========

Bunnymod for Half-Life mods.

##Build
You need Detours 3.0 (the free version will do) to build this.

##Installation
* Go to your Half-Life folder.
* Rename DemoPlayer.dll there into DemoPlayer_original.dll.
* Copy the built DemoPlayer.dll into the Half-Life folder.
* If you're playing on Steam, **MAKE SURE YOU PLAY SINGLEPLAYER ONLY. YOU MIGHT GET VAC BANNED IF YOU CONNECT TO A SECURE SERVER.**
* Launch Half-Life. A console window should appear containing all kinds of debug information.
