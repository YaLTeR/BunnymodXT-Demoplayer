Bunnymod XT
==========

Bunnymod for Half-Life mods.

##Build
You need Detours 3.0 (the free version will do) to build this.

##Installation
1. Go to your Half-Life folder.
2. Rename DemoPlayer.dll there into DemoPlayer_original.dll.
3. Copy the built DemoPlayer.dll into the Half-Life folder.
4. If you're playing on Steam, **MAKE SURE YOU PLAY SINGLEPLAYER ONLY. YOU MIGHT GET VAC BANNED IF YOU CONNECT TO A SECURE SERVER.**
5. Launch Half-Life. A console window should appear containing all kinds of debug information.
